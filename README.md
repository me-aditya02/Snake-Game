This is an advanced version of the classic Snake Game, powered by AI path-finding algorithms. Built using Python and Pygame, the game features a grid-based environment where the snake automatically finds its way to the food using smart decision-making. The challenge increases with each level as obstacles are added, and a 30-second timer keeps the pressure on.

**Features:**
The snake moves automatically using search algorithms like BFS, DFS, UCS, IDS, Greedy BFS, and A*.
Supports 4 difficulty levels based on obstacle density.
Obstacles and food are randomly placed and remain static during the game.
Game ends if the snake:
Hits a wall or obstacle.
Fails to reach the food in 30 seconds.

** What Makes It Unique:**
Includes a Random Movement mode for baseline testing.
Compare the efficiency of algorithms based on:
Time taken to find the food.
Number of moves.

You have to install pygame to play the game.
